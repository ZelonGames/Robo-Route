In a distant future, humanity has colonized multiple planets and explored space. Robots have become crucial in extracting resources from these planets and transporting them back to Earth.

But one day, something terrible happens - a massive meteorite storm hits the entire solar system. These meteorites have destroyed much of the transport network, preventing the robots from returning to Earth. The robots that survived the disaster are now without any way to transport the resources to their respective portals.

This is where the player comes in. As one of the few engineers who are still alive, it is up to you to repair the transport network and ensure that the robots can deliver the resources to the right portal.

Each portal leads to a different planet where the robots need to retrieve specific resources. For example, the green portal leads to a forest world where the robots need to collect trees and other vegetation, while the red portal leads to a mineral-rich planet where the robots need to collect precious gems and metals.

But without any roads to transport the resources on, the player must build new roads and transportation mechanisms using various items such as platforms, elevators, slides, and other objects to guide the robots to the right place.

As the player progresses through different levels, it becomes increasingly difficult to guide the robots correctly and avoid obstacles and hazards on the planets. But if you manage to complete each level, the robots will be able to deliver the valuable resources back to Earth and save humanity's future.
