**Backstory**

In a distant galaxy, there lay a group of human colonies. These colonies were dependent on the resources produced in each sector and then transported to one another through a system of portals.

But one day, something terrible happened. One of the largest asteroids in the galaxy collided with one of the colonies, creating a massive explosion that caused destruction on a scale never seen before. The roads that led to the portals in several sectors were severely damaged, and the transport of resources between sectors came to a halt.

You were one of the chief engineers in the colonies, but you were also the only one who survived the catastrophe. You have now been tasked with repairing the roads and restoring the transport network alone. It is an almost impossible task, as each sector has its own challenges and requires different strategies to restore the roads.

In each sector, you must find and use the resources available to build new roads and repair the damaged ones. It could be anything from collecting materials from wreckage of destroyed vessels to building new bridges and tunnels through mountain ranges or forests.

You will need to be both creative and persevering, finding new ways to solve problems. But you also have your knowledge and experience as an engineer, and your determination to fight for the colonies and restore the transport network.

Although it may feel overwhelming and lonely at times, you have the hope that you will become a hero who saves the colonies and restores peace to the galaxy. Good luck!
